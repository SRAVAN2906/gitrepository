What Is Git?
================
|-Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It helps in coordinating work amongst several people in a project and tracks progress over time. Unlike the centralized version control system, Git branches can be easily merged. A new branch is created every time a developer wants to start working on something. This ensures that the master branch always has a production-quality code.

|-Git is a distributed version control system, so here, every developer gets their local repository with full commit history. The commit history makes Git fast, as now a network connection is not needed to create commits or perform diffs between commits.


What Is GitHub?
=================
|-GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface (GUI). It helps every team member work together on a project from anywhere, making it easy to collaborate. 

|-GitHub is one place where project managers and developers coordinate, track, and update their work, so projects stay transparent and on schedule. The packages can be published privately, within the team, or publicly for the open-source community. Downloading packages from GitHub enables them to be used and reused. GitHub helps all team members stay on the same page and stay organized. Moderation tools, like issue and pull request locking, helps the team focus on the code.
